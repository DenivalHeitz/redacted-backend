This wasn’t Lewis Hamilton’s finest weekend, but as he’s so often done, he found a way to grind out victory – courtesy
of some smart driving and a cracking reactive strategy from Mercedes – to retake the championship lead.

Remarkably, it was only his second win in the last 11 races, but it was a historic one. A century of Grand Prix
victories is a phenomenal achievement. Sure, he’s had the best car for a large chunk of his career, but you’ve still got
to get the job done. And as we saw once again in Sochi, it’s not easy.
